## 🔒 Security Issues

### Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

For security-related issues, **DO NOT** open a public GitHub Issue.

Instead, use GitHub's private security reporting:

**→ [Report a Security Vulnerability](https://github.com/SamoTech/Wazivo/security/advisories/new)**

**Security issues include:**
- Data leaks or exposure
- Authentication/authorization bypass
- XSS or injection vulnerabilities
- API key exposure
- Any security weakness

**We take security seriously:**
- All reports are reviewed within 48 hours
- We'll work with you to understand and fix the issue
- You'll be credited (if desired) when the fix is released

- Data access requests ("What data do you have about me?")
- Data deletion requests ("Delete my data")
- Data portability requests ("Export my data")
- Questions about data handling
- Cookie/tracking concerns

### Our Privacy Commitment

- ✅ **No tracking** - We don't use analytics or tracking cookies
- ✅ **API privacy** - Groq API processes data securely
